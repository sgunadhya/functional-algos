# algos
This project contains code for practicing algorithms in Haskell Programming Language. The code is from the following books:
- Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design
- Algorithm Design using Haskell

My intent behind starting this project is to understand modern Haskell software development using stack, understand test-driven development in Haskell, and get a new perspective of Algorithm design using functional programming and Haskell.
